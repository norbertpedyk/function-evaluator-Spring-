Function evaluation application with toggleable functions

Tasks:
- compilation errors must be fixed
- there are tasks defined in the code, marked with comment: //TODO: 
- use as much Spring built-in features as possible (if it makes sense)
- if some parts of the solution require additional comment, you can add it as Javadocs (in English) - but it's not required if something is self-explanatory

Hints:
- Start with taking a look at the ValueEvaluationService interface and its comments - this should give you a high level idea of the domain of this app
- Once you understand the processing rules, take a look at SampleEvaluationsController and related comments/tasks
- you can keep the existing structure of classes (Results and Evaluators) but if you have a better idea, you can reimplement it. 
  Please ensure, though, that you don't change the REST API. Also please remember to keep the code clean and open for extensions
